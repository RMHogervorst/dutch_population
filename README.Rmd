# dutch_population

The goal of dutch_population is to create modified maps of the Netherlands based on population density.

things I 'd like to try:

* population ridge lines like James Cheshire http://spatial.ly/2017/04/population-lines-how-and-why-i-created-it/
* morph the map so that municipalities are shrinked or enlarged based on their population.
